First, Billboard continuously changed how they chose the rank of the Hot 100. In the ’60s, they loosely polled record stores, and sometimes just switched things up to keep it interesting. Later they started looking at stream count, which measures completely different user behavior (e.g., it takes into account those who listen to songs on repeat, which radio never could).","For example: You might notice that, as time goes on, there seem to be fewer songs, and songs on average spend longer in the Top 10. Are today’s songs just… more popular than ever? Unclear. It’s hard to know how much of this comes from changing listener behavior vs how Billboard measures listener behavior.","The best we can do is compare the relative popularity of a song to songs from the same era. It’s not safe to conclude, say, that Doja Cat’s <span class=song-title>Kiss Me More</span> was more popular than The Beatle’s <span class=song-title>Day Tripper</span> simply because it spent longer on the Top 10. Popularity was measured completely differently for each.","Second, even if Billboard rankings <i>were</i> made consistently, rankings (“ordinal measures,” for the geeks) kinda suck for deriving aggregate, quantitative comparisons. Billboard provides us each song’s rank, but nothing about how close or far one song was from another. For example, in January 2019, was Hasley’s <span class=song-title>Without Me</span> at #1 because it was twice as popular as Ariana’s <span class=song-title>Thank U, Next</span> #2? Or did it barely edge it out?","The data is messy, so we ended up keeping our popularity metric simple: tally the total number of weeks the song was within the Top 10, irrespective of its specific rank. The popularity scores derived from this approach closely correlate with scoring methods that take rank into account, so we felt pretty happy proceeding with it."]},{title:"How did you decide which of the 5,100 songs were love songs?",paragraphs:["We did a lot of labeling by hand. Once we had a solid approach (see below) and a lot of examples, we <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding/pop-love-songs/blob/main/GPT%20prompt%20used%20to%20label%20love%20song%20types.md target=_blank>wrote a prompt</a> and used GPT4o to label the rest. We iterated a lot on that prompt until it became pretty accurate. By the end, we found GPT made very few mistakes, and most mistakes we did find were simply songs that would have been genuinely ambiguous for a human labeler, as well.","I, David, was honestly very surprised by how accurate GPT4o ended up being, after a lot of experimentation. Eventually, we found that model accuracy was most improved by: (a) in the output, having the model first write a justification before making its final categorization and (b) in the prompt, providing a lot of examples with justifications.","The explanation for this seems related to how LLMs work: since they generate outputs token by token, giving the model space to first “think through” a justification results in a more accurate classification. And, naturally, more examples increased the model’s clarity on our classification system."]},{title:"[SPOILER ALERT] How did you develop and and then assign your seven love song types?",paragraphs:['I, Michelle, come from a qualitative research background, so we used a process called "clustering" to find "themes" in a large volume of qualitative data (in this case, music and lyrics). (Mentally, this is a similar process to what happens when Humanities scholars find the themes in a body of literary or philosophical work!)',"We started with the most obvious song types -- the Serenade -- and slowly expanded towards types that seemed to defy these, until we had created a collection of themes that seemed to represent the vast majority, if not all of the songs. This process involved going back and forth between our own lived experience of what love songs existed, and testing the framework -- with GPT4o's help -- against the actual data to find exceptions and improve our model. Every time GPT4o came back with labelled data, we combed through by hand to see how much we agreed. The disagreements produced new insights.","Still not satisfied? <i>Ok, here’s a bit more of the details:</i>","At our least structured, we were simply assessing the songs we saw, and adjusting categories to better match them.","At our most structured (and where we tried to start the process), we came up with a matrix made of two metrics. Here it is:","love-song-type-matrix-attempt.png","Here’s how it worked: Given love songs are fundamentally about the romantic dynamics between (at least) two people, the first metric defined the relationship between the speaker and their subject: the speaker has/had feelings toward someone, and they either (a) might love them back, (b) do love them back or (c) don’t love them back (but might have once). The second metric was how traditional the treatment of love was. As you can see, the less traditional love song types often straddle multiple relationship categories.","In the end, we felt the framework was more confusing than helpful, but it helped us land on our ultimate love song categories.","Ultimately, there is no perfect set of categories that could capture the nuance of every love song, and we had to make a lot of interpretive leaps. Many songs straddle the line between two categories, and in those cases, we had to make judgement calls.","<i>For the data nerds</i>:","We did also try looking for clusters in a text embedding of each song’s lyrics. This yielded poor initial results, so we didn’t explore it futher.","Text embedding tended to cluster songs around the literal words and images they used, rather than the meaning or intent behind the words.","For example, while <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding/pop-love-songs/blob/main/GPT%20prompt%20used%20to%20label%20love%20song%20types.md target=_blank>our ChatGPT prompt</a> was able to correctly place <span class=song-title>Urgent</span> by Foreigner into the category <span class=sexual-confidence>Sexual Confidence</span>, text embedding failed to cluster it with other such songs because it consists largely of innuendo (eg “That's why you call me in the middle of the night / You say it's urgent”).","The prevalence of songs like <span class=song-title>Urgent</span> -- which are thematically related but textually quite different from other songs like <span class=song-title>WAP</span> -- made LLMs a better choice than text embedding. Or maybe I, David, just need to get better at embedding and clustering 🤷."]},{title:"Besides what you did by hand and with an LLM, where did you get your data?",paragraphs:["From <a href=https://github.com/utdata/rwd-billboard-data/blob/main/data-out/hot-100-current.csv target=_blank>this scrape of weekly Billboard Hot 100 rankings</a> we looked at songs from 1959 - September 2023 (the cutoff date was chosen to be safety within the window that OpenAI’s GPT4o was trained on).
