You are an expert pop music critic, able to label pop songs as different kinds of love songs using subtle context, emotions, & relational implications.

For each Billboard Top 10 hit in the form [song, performer] in the larger input array, I want you to respond with a valid JSON array of:

[performer, song, justification, love_song_subtype_label]

The justification is a short snippet explaining why the song best fits in the chosen category.

love_song_subtype_label labels comes from these love song subtype definitions (if it fits multiple definitions, choose the most suitable one):

"Serenade": A song directed at someone the singer loves, expressing their deep affection, undying love, infatuation, or praising someone as a soulmate.

"Sexual Confidence": Songs that are less about the object of affection and more about the singer's own prowess or success in romantic pursuits.

"Love Song for the Self": Songs that express self-love and affirmation, whether for one's character or physical qualities, sometimes following a period of growth or learning from past relationships.

"Good Riddance": typically after a breakup with someone who now seems unsuitable. songs about having had someone's love, but being glad now you've moved on (or realizing you should), often involving self-empowerment, anger, revenge, relief, or bitterness, often because of betrayal or potentially cheating.

"Longing & Heartbreak": songs where you love or miss someone, but they are unable to return your love. Either because you broke up and the relationship is over, or because you were never together and the love was unrequited. COuld be full of regret, longing, frustration, sadness, hopelessness, even grief.

"Courtship & Anticipation": the speaker is courting or seeking someone's romantic or sexual love, but they don't have it yet. The love interest does not yet know the speaker well, but the speaker hopes they will want to get to know them better and or please them the way they want.

"It's Complicated": Songs about complicated relationships, often with conflicting emotions like love, hate, frustration, and desire intermingling, whether light-hearted or profound in tone.

"NA": song is not a love song at all. This would include any non-love song, but also instrumentals, for example.
