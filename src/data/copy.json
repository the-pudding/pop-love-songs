First, Billboard continuously changed how they chose the rank of the Hot 100. In the ’60s, they loosely polled record stores, and sometimes just switched things up to keep it interesting. Later they started looking at stream count, which measures completely different user behavior (e.g., it takes into account those who listen to songs on repeat, which radio never could).","For example: You might notice that, as time goes on, there seem to be fewer songs, and songs on average spend longer in the Top 10. Are today’s songs just… more popular than ever? Unclear. It’s hard to know how much of this comes from changing listener behavior vs how Billboard measures listener behavior.","The best we can do is compare the relative popularity of a song to songs from the same era. It’s not safe to conclude, say, that Doja Cat’s “Kiss Me More” was more popular than The Beatle’s “Day Tripper” simply because it spent longer on the Top 10. Popularity was measured completely differently for each.","Second, even if Billboard rankings <i>were</i> made consistently, rankings (“ordinal measures,” for the geeks) kinda suck for deriving aggregate, quantitative comparisons. Billboard provides us each song’s rank, but nothing about how close or far one song was from another. For example, in January 2019, was Hasley’s “Without Me” at #1 because it was twice as popular as Ariana’s “Thank U, Next” #2? Or did it barely edge it out?","The data is messy, so we ended up keeping our popularity metric simple: tally the total number of weeks the song was within the Top 10, irrespective of its specific rank. The popularity scores derived from this approach closely correlate with scoring methods that take rank into account, so we felt pretty happy proceeding with it."]},{"title":"How did you decide which of the 5,100 songs were love songs?","paragraphs":["We did a lot of labeling by hand. Once we had a solid approach (see below) and a lot of examples, we <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding/pop-love-songs/blob/main/GPT%20prompt%20used%20to%20label%20love%20song%20types.md target=_blank>wrote a prompt</a> and used GPT4o to label the rest. We iterated a lot on that prompt until it became pretty accurate. By the end, we found GPT made very few mistakes, and most mistakes we did find were simply songs that would have been genuinely ambiguous for a human labeler, as well.","I, David, was honestly very surprised by how accurate GPT4o ended up being, after a lot of experimentation. The experimentation pointed to a clear art to writing a good prompting. Model accuracy was most improved by: (a) in the output, having the model first write a justification before making its final categorization and (b) in the prompt, providing a lot of examples with justifications.","The explanation for this seems related to how LLMs work: since they generate outputs token by token, giving the model space to first “think through” a justification results in a more accurate classification. And, naturally, more examples increased the model’s clarity on our classification system."]},{"title":"[SPOILER ALERT] How did you develop and and then assign your seven love song types?","paragraphs":["TLDR: a ton of trial and error to determine categories that captured all songs and didn’t overlap; then a ton of trial and error using an LLM (GPT4o) to label them, reviewing the results, and iterating more on the system.","A bit more detail:","At our least structured, we were simply assessing the songs we saw, and adjusting categories to better match them.","At our most structured (and where we tried to start the process), we came up with a matrix made of two metrics. Here it is:","love-song-type-matrix-attempt.png","Here’s how it worked: Given love songs are fundamentally about the romantic dynamics between (at least) two people, the first metric defined the relationship between the speaker and their subject: the speaker has/had feelings toward someone, and they either (a) might love them back, (b) do love them back or (c) don’t love them back (but might have once). The second metric was how traditional the treatment of love was. As you can see, the less traditional love song types often straddle multiple relationship categories.","In the end, we felt the framework was more confusing than helpful, but it helped us land on our ultimate love song categories.","For the data nerds: We did also try looking for clusters in a text embedding of each song’s lyrics. This yielded poor initial results, so we didn’t explore it futher. Text embedding tended to cluster songs around the literal words and images they used, rather than the meaning or intent behind the words. For example, while <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding/pop-love-songs/blob/main/GPT%20prompt%20used%20to%20label%20love%20song%20types.md target=_blank>our ChatGPT prompt</a> was able to correctly place \"Urgent\" by Foreigner into the category “Sexual Confidence,” text embedding failed to cluster it with other such songs because consists largely of innuendo (eg “That's why you call me in the middle of the night / You say it's urgent”). Contrast this with the literal words found in songs like “WAP.”"]},{"title":"Besides what you did by hand and with an LLM, where did you get your data?","paragraphs":["From <a href=https://github.com/utdata/rwd-billboard-data/blob/main/data-out/hot-100-current.csv target=_blank>this scrape of weekly Billboard Hot 100 rankings</a> we looked at songs from 1959 - September 2023 (the cutoff date was chosen to be safety within the window that OpenAI’s GPT4o was trained on). There are 5,141 unique songs.","We used GPT to split out individual artist artists from the credit of each song. We merged some names where there was variation in the same artist’s name or spelling (eg Jay-Z and JAY-Z)."]}],"commentText":{"boomerBobComment":"They don't make love songs like they used to… Nowadays it's just sex, drugs and me me me!!!","alternate":"They don’t make love songs like they used to… No cussing, no nudity, just pure talent!"},"stepText":{"haveYouSeenTheseYouTubeComments":{"copy":"Have you ever seen a comment like this?
