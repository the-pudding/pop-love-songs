{"title":"Is the Love Song Dying?","description":"We categorized songs in the Billboard Top 10 to see if love songs are on the decline.","url":"https://pudding.cool/2024/09/love-songs","keywords":"billboard, pop music, love songs","byline":"By <a href=https://pudding.cool/author/david-mora/ target=_blank>David Mora</a> and <a href=https://pudding.cool/author/michelle-jia/ target=_blank>Michelle Jia</a>","dataMethods":[{"title":"How did you develop and and then assign your love song types?","paragraphs":["TLDR: a ton of trial and error to determine categories that captured all songs and didn’t overlap; then a ton of trial and error to get a LLM (GPT4o) to label them.","A bit more detail: At our least structured, we were simply assessing the songs we saw, and adjusting categories to better match them. At our most structured (and where we tried to start the process), we came up with a matrix made of two metrics. Given love songs are fundamentally about the romantic dynamics between (at least) two people, the first metric defined the relationship between between the speaker and their subject: the speaker has/had feelings toward someone, and they either (a) might love them back, (b) do love them back or (c) don’t love them back (but might have once). The second metric was how traditional the treatment of love was.","In the end, the framework ended up being more confusing than helpful, but it helped us land on our ultimate love song categories."]},{"title":"How did you determine the popularity of each song?","paragraphs":["TLDR: popularity = number of weeks in the Billboard Top 10 (does not have to be continuous weeks)","Coming up with a popularity metric was tricky. First, Billboard continulsouly changed how they chose the rank of the Hot 100. In the ’60s, they loosely polled record stores, and sometimes just switched things up to keep it interesting. Later they started looking at stream count, which measures completely different user behavior (e.g., listening to songs on repeat, or personal vs radio popularity).","Second, even if Billboard rankings were made consistently, rankings (“ordinal measures,” for the geeks) kinda suck compared to quantitative popularity metrics. We know the rank, but nothing about how close or far one song was from another. For example, in January 2019, was Hasley’s “Without Me” at #1 because it was was twice as popular as Ariana’s “Thank U, Next” #2? Or did it barely edge it out?","The data is messy, so we ended up keeping our popularity metric simple: tally the total number of weeks the song was within the Top 10, ignoring specific rank. Also, popularity scores from this approach also closely correlate scoring methods that take rank into account."]},{"title":"Besides what you did by hand and with an LLM, here did you get your data?","paragraphs":["From <a href=https://github.com/utdata/rwd-billboard-data/blob/main/data-out/hot-100-current.csv target=_blank>this scrape of weekly Billboard Hot 100 rankings</a> we looked at songs from 1959 - September 2023 (the cutoff date was chosen to be safety within the window that OpenAI’s GPT4o was trained on). There are 5,141 unique songs.","We used GPT to split out individual artist artists from the credit of each song. We merged some names where there was variation in the same artist’s name or spelling (eg Jay-Z and JAY-Z)."]}],"stepText":{"haveYouSeenTheseYouTubeComments":"Have you ever seen a comment like this? They seem to be part of a larger sentiment: something about contemporary music is in decline.","boomerBobSaysLoveSongsAreDying":"This Baby Boomer-centric sentiment seems to crystalize around one topic in particular: modern pop music’s treatment of love & romance—or the lack thereof. According to Boomer Bob, the love song is dying. But is it true? Let’s investigate...","titleCard":"","allTheBillboardHitsInAMonoChromeCluster":"Here are all 5,100 Billboard Top 10 hits from 1958 to September 2023. Each bubble is a song. The bigger the bubble, the longer it spent in the Top 10 (regardless of its <button class=modalTrigger>exact rank</button>).","highlightSerenadesWithinCluster":"These are the 1,040 Top 10 hits we think Boomer Bob would <i>definitely</i> consider love songs (labeled <button class=modalTrigger>by hand and with ChatGPT</button>). All these songs are unmistakably about romantic love and devotion. They play at weddings and proms.","serenadesAreIndeedDying":"If you spread these classic love songs on a timeline, they are indeed declining...","serenadesPeakedInThe90s":"If you spread these classic love songs on a timeline, you see them peak in the ’90s with hits like “I'll Make Love to You” by Boyz II Men...","aFewArtistsKeepThemAliveToday":"... then they wane. Today, only a few artists, such as Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift, consistently chart with classic love songs. But how much have these types of love songs dropped off, exactly?","anAggSnakeChartMakesBoomerBobSeemRight":"To see, here are the love songs as a proportion of all other Billboard Top 10 hits. The proportion of love songs in the 1960s was 23%. In the 2020s, it’s 12%. The proportion of love songs has almost halved! So, was Boomer Bob right? Are love songs, in fact, dying?","butWeWillTakeAMoreExpansiveView":"Not quite: we think Boomer Bob has too narrow of a view of love. Sure, these lovey-dovey tunes have declined. But what about other songs? What about “I Will Always Love You” by Whitney Houston? Is “Buy U A Drank” by T-Pain a love song? Or “WAP?” If we look more closely, we uncover a story that will change how you see love in pop music.","whyWeCare":"It's easy to just shake our fists and say, “Kids these days don’t value love anymore!” But, instead, if we challenge ourselves to look deeper at love songs—and romance itself—we uncover a far more complex (and fascinating) story. A story that will change how you see love in pop music.","definingSerenades":"Earlier we showed you the most obvious form of love songs, the classic love song. They deserve a better label: let’s call call them <span class=serenade>Serenades</span>. These songs describe a simple relationship: you love someone, and they love you back!","colorInHeartbreak":"But what happens if you love them, but they just... don’t? Let’s call this type of love song “Longing & Heartbreak.”","introducingLongingAndHeartbreak":"Think: The Beatles’ “Yesterday” or Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You”","longingAndHeartbreakComparedToSerenade":"The total number of Top 10 spots occupied by “Longing & Heartbreak” surpassed “Serenades” in the 2020s. “Blinding Lights” by The Weeknd played a big role, spending 57 weeks in the Top 10. Note: for each decade, love song types are sorted vertically sorted by popularity (which is why “Hearbreak” jumps above “Serenade” in the 2020s).","longingAndHeartbreakDoNotTipTheScales":"Did adding Longing & Heartbreak save the love song? Nope! Their decline is still dramatic: from 45% of all songs in the ’60s, to 27% in the 2020s.","introducingCourtship":"But we’re just getting started... How about when you love someone, and it  <i>might </i> become something more? You just spotted someone, your heart is beating fast, and who KNOWS where this thing might lead?","courtshipHasNoEffect":"These “Courtship & Anticipation” songs remain fairly steady over time, so the love song is still in decline and Boomer Boomer Bob remains right. I mean, what aspects of love could you sing about beyond new love, true love, and heartbreak (“'Courtship & Anticipation,” “Serenades,” and “Longing & Heartbreak”)?","introducingItsComplicated":"From our perspective: a lot, if you’re willing to explore the messier side of romance! What about when a relationship isn’t clearly good <i>or</i> bad? Maybe you fight consantly. Maybe they’re unfaithful. But you still try to make it work, because... well, “It's Complicated!”","itsComplicatedDoesNotTipTheScales":"Can this angst-y genre save the love song? No, but we’re getting closer!","introducingGoodRiddance":"What about those songs where the relationship  <i>is </i> clearly over, but the songwriter’s heartbreak has resurrected into... righteous power? They’re not crying, they’re yelling “Good Riddance!”","goodRiddanceDoesNotTipTheScale":"With the predominantly modern “Good Riddance” love song, maybe love is not dead; it’s just a little wounded.","introducingSexualConfidence":"What about songs that get a little steamy? Think artists like Nicki Minaj and Drake, who dominate this category.","sexualConfidenceInContext":"As Boomers bemoan, these “Sexual Confidence” songs exploded in popularity, nearly eclipsing the Serenade in the 2000s. When we include this sensual side of love, the love song isn’t dying after all, but  just as popular as in Boomer Bob’s day! But we’re not done quite yet.","introducingLoveSongForTheSelf":"We’ve ventured  <i>very</i> far from the Serenade. Far enough to find its reincarnation: songs where heartbreak turns love back onto the OG, yourself. “You don't love me? That’s ok, because I do! In fact, I’ll buy <i>myself</i> flowers…”","didLoveSongForTheSelfTipTheScales":"This women-pioneered “Love Song for the Self” is the most modern of all the genres. And while it’s not written <i>to</i> a lover, it’s often written  <i>in reaction to</i> romantic rejection. Let’s return to our central question: Is the love song dying?","theLoveSongIsActuallyRising":"Not at all. In fact, it’s increasingly <b>more popular</b>! The love song didn’t die; it evolved. People are loving, losing, and connecting in more ways than ever before. We argue that modern pop is just as romantic as ever, just maybe in ways that Boomer Bob doesn’t recognize.","youDecide":"That’s using our criteria. The status of love songs depends on what <i>you</i> believe should or should not count as a love song (Boomer Bob probably still only counts Serenades!). So, you decide: add and remove categories based on your love song beliefs, and tell <i>us</i> how the love song is doing!"}}
